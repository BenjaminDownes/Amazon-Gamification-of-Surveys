Notes: DynamoDB access information (region, key, & secret key) were removed from the code

Project Description:
Issue: At Amazon, there has been an ongoing issue with feedback collection on their Seller Central Forum page. There is a survey widget tool in place to collect user feedback; however, turnout is very low and inconsistent.
Solution: We will design a gamification system to motivate more users to participate through a point system where users can earn points, rank up, and earn accomplishments.

Project Summary:
We created a mock website that simulated potential gamification features that Amazon could adopt to improve their survey system. Our website utilizes DynamoDB and S3 to host and store our data. Currently, the website supports database look-up to login and pulls profile information through this linking. The home page has a temp avatar and temp profile information, and a leaderboard that reflects top point holders. The profile page shows user points, user rank, and has 10 accomplishments on display with working progress bars. Through that page, there are also minigames, currently it has snake and tetris. The survey page contains a preset number of questions and allocates a set amount of points for successful completion. Most pages offer page traversal, such as return to home page or sign out.
